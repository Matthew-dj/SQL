#In this SQL, I'm querying a database that has various tables to calculate statistics on customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT (jan.orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
WHERE LENGTH (jan.orderID)=6
AND jan.orderID IS NOT NULL; 

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (jan.orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
WHERE jan.Product='iPhone'
AND LENGTH (jan.orderID)=6
AND jan.orderID IS NOT NULL ;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT (c.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON c.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE LENGTH (c.order_id)=6
AND c.order_id IS NOT NULL; 

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT jan.Product, MIN(jan.price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
WHERE LENGTH (jan.orderID)=6
AND jan.orderID IS NOT NULL; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT jan.Product, SUM (jan.Quantity)*jan.price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
WHERE LENGTH (jan.orderID)=6
AND jan.orderID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY jan.Product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT feb.Product, feb.Quantity, SUM (feb.Quantity)*feb.price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
WHERE feb.location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID IS NOT NULL

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(feb.Quantity*feb.price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON c.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE feb.Quantity>2
AND LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID IS NOT NULL

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT feb.Product, SUM(feb.Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
WHERE feb.location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
AND LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID IS NOT NULL
